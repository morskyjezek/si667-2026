    "\n",
    "The above activity demonstrates the steps to create fixity information, file manifests, and associated descriptive information - **basic preservation metadata** - for a group of files. Using an agreed-upon file packaging specification, like BagIt, allows digital curators \n",
    "to create information packages that contain basic information about the contents, and can \n",
    "help organizations exchanging content to ensure that the content that was sent was the content that was received.\n",
    "Moreover, keeping this information together can allow a repository, its maintainers, and its users, to \n",
    "be able to have some assurance that information received now is the same as that originally received."
